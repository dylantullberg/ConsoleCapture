## üìñ Revised README

# ConsoleCapture

**ConsoleCapture** is a Chrome extension that allows developers and web enthusiasts to selectively capture and copy different types of console logs from web pages with a click. With the ability to filter and instantly copy to clipboard specific log types (such as `log`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `deprecation warnings`, `network errors`, `CORS errors`, `security warnings`, and `exceptions`), this tool streamlines the debugging process. It also includes an optional auto-copy feature, ensuring that logs are copied as soon as a page loads. All captured data is stored locally, with no external sharing of information.

## üîë Key Features:
- **Selective Console Log Capture:** Filter and capture specific types of logs (`log`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `deprecation warnings`, `network errors`, `CORS errors`, `security warnings`, `exceptions`) based on your needs.
- **Grouped Copy Buttons:** 
  - **Copy All Errors:** Aggregate and copy all error-related logs (`ERROR`, `EXCEPTION`, `NETWORKERROR`, `CORSERROR`).
  - **Copy All Warnings:** Aggregate and copy all warning-related logs (`WARNING`, `DEPRECATIONWARNING`, `SECURITYWARNING`).
- **Clipboard Integration:** Copy the selected logs directly to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Auto-Copy on Page Load:** Automatically copy logs to the clipboard when the page fully loads.
- **User Notifications:** Get visual feedback when logs are copied or if no logs are available.
- **Badge Counts:** Each log category button displays a badge indicating the number of captured logs. Badges are conditionally shown only when there are entries.
- **Local Storage:** All captured logs are stored locally and are not transmitted to external servers.
- **Badge Reset on Stop:** Clear the log type counts (badges) automatically when capturing is stopped.

### üìù Sample Test HTML Page:

To facilitate testing of various console logs and ensure that **ConsoleCapture** functions as expected, use the following sample HTML page. This page intentionally triggers different types of console logs, including Deprecation Warnings, Network Errors, CORS Errors, Info, and Debug logs.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>ConsoleCapture Test Page</title>
  <script>
    // Triggering an Unhandled Rejection (will be grouped under Exceptions)
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      reject('This is an unhandled rejection!');
    });

    // Triggering a Deprecation Warning
    console.warn('This API is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.');

    // Triggering a Network Error
    fetch('https://nonexistent.domain12345.com/resource')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .catch(error => console.error('Network Error:', error));

    // Triggering a CORS Error
    // Note: To reliably trigger a CORS error, fetch a resource from a different origin without proper CORS headers.
    // For demonstration, using an invalid endpoint. Replace with a suitable URL if needed.
    fetch('https://example.com/invalid-cors-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .catch(error => console.error('CORS Error:', error));

    // Triggering a Security Warning (Mixed Content)
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = 'http://insecure-website.com/image.jpg'; // Loading from HTTP on an HTTPS page
    document.body.appendChild(img);

    // Triggering Info and Debug Logs
    console.info('This is an info log for testing.');
    console.debug('This is a debug log for testing.');
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>ConsoleCapture Test Page</h1>
  <p>This page is designed to generate specific console logs for testing the ConsoleCapture extension.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation of Test Cases:**

1. **Unhandled Rejection:**
   - **Code:**
     ```javascript
     new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       reject('This is an unhandled rejection!');
     });
     ```
   - **Expected Log:** Should be captured under the "Exceptions" category.

2. **Deprecation Warning:**
   - **Code:**
     ```javascript
     console.warn('This API is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.');
     ```
   - **Expected Log:** Should trigger a Deprecation Warning.

3. **Network Error:**
   - **Code:**
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://nonexistent.domain12345.com/resource')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .catch(error => console.error('Network Error:', error));
     ```
   - **Expected Log:** Should capture a Network Error due to an invalid domain.

4. **CORS Error:**
   - **Code:**
     ```javascript
     fetch('https://example.com/invalid-cors-endpoint')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .catch(error => console.error('CORS Error:', error));
     ```
   - **Expected Log:** Should capture a CORS Error because the endpoint lacks proper CORS headers.

   - **Note:** Replace `'https://example.com/invalid-cors-endpoint'` with a valid URL that does not support CORS if needed for more reliable testing.

5. **Security Warning (Mixed Content):**
   - **Code:**
     ```javascript
     const img = new Image();
     img.src = 'http://insecure-website.com/image.jpg'; // Loading from HTTP on an HTTPS page
     document.body.appendChild(img);
     ```
   - **Expected Log:** Should capture a Security Warning related to mixed content.

6. **Info and Debug Logs:**
   - **Code:**
     ```javascript
     console.info('This is an info log for testing.');
     console.debug('This is a debug log for testing.');
     ```
   - **Expected Logs:** Should be captured under the "Info" and "Debug" categories respectively.

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon16.png
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon48.png
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon128.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ material-icons.css
```

**Notes:**
- **Icons:**
  - Ensure that all icon files (`icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`, and `material-icons.css`) are correctly placed in the `icons` directory.
- **File Paths:**
  - Verify that all file paths referenced in `manifest.json` and `popup.html` are accurate.

## üîí Compliance and Permissions Considerations

Ensure that your extension adheres to Chrome's extension policies and manages permissions appropriately.

1. **Permissions Required:**
   - **`clipboardWrite`:** Necessary for the copy-to-clipboard functionality.
   - **`debugger`:** Required for attaching the debugger to capture logs via the Debugger API.
   - **`activeTab` and `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`):** Allow the extension to access and capture logs from any webpage.
   - **`scripting` and `storage`:** Already included and necessary for capturing and managing logs.

2. **Handling Sensitive Data:**
   - **Privacy:** Ensure that the logs being captured do not inadvertently contain sensitive user information.
   - **Filtering:** Implement filters or allow users to exclude certain types of logs if needed.

3. **User Consent:**
   - **Transparency:** Inform users about the types of logs being captured and how they can manage or clear them.
   - **Control:** Provide options to start/stop capturing and to clear logs, giving users control over their data.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - **Graceful Failures:** Handle scenarios where permissions are denied or clipboard access fails, providing clear feedback to the user.

5. **Security:**
   - **Sanitization:** Ensure that any data copied to the clipboard is sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
